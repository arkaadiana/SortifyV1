## How to Run the Application

For users who only want to run the application without development, simply open the `.exe` file located in the [`dist`](./dist)[ folder](./dist).

## How to Develop the Application

If you want to develop or modify the application, follow these steps:

1. **Create a virtual environment (.venv)**

   ```sh
   python -m venv .venv
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment**

   - Windows (Command Prompt):
     ```sh
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - Windows (PowerShell):
     ```sh
     .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```
   - Linux/Mac:
     ```sh
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install required dependencies**

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application in development mode**

   ```sh
   python src/main.py
   ```

## How to Create an .exe File

If you want to package the application into an .exe file, run the following command:

```sh
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=assets/sortify.ico --name=SortifyV1 src/main.py
```

The output will be in the [`dist`](./dist)[ folder](./dist).
